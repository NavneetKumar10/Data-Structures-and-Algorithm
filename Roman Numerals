Certainly! Let's convert an integer to a Roman numeral. We'll follow the rules you've provided for Roman numerals:

1. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.
2. They are usually written in largest to smallest order from left to right.
3. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
    - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
    - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
    - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Let's implement an algorithm to convert an integer to a Roman numeral:

1. Create two arrays:
    - One for storing the values of Roman numerals (`values`).
    - Another for storing the corresponding letters (`symbols`).
2. Initialize an empty `StringBuilder` to build the Roman numeral.
3. Compare the integer with Roman numerals and do the following:
    - If the input number is greater than or equal to the highest Roman numeral value, add the corresponding symbol to the `StringBuilder` and reduce its corresponding value from the input number.
    - If the input number is less than the highest Roman numeral value, then check with the next highest Roman numerals.
    - Repeat the process above until the input number becomes 0.
4. The `StringBuilder` will be the corresponding Roman numeral.

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        int[] values = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
        String[] symbols = {"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
            while (num >= values[i]) {
                num -= values[i];
                result.append(symbols[i]);
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
